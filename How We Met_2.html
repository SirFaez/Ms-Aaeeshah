                In the next following months, I've started to notice small things, keyword, I've and small. On her IG stories, she posted something along the line of ‚Äòcrush‚Äô at school, I brushed it off and thought nothing of it. During class, I've noticed someone taking a few glances at me, and it was none other than her, I caught her glancing at me during Geography, she immediately glanced away, üßê. After our school Raya celebration in I think during May or June, when i came back to school for afternoon class, i was gifted a coffee bean drink with a small note next to it. The note mentioned that it was a gift from Izzan and her friends. Thats so nice of them,although i genuinely thought it was just a thank you gift for helping with the raya decoration, because i did spend a lot of money on it +_+.<br><br>

                On 21/6/2022, on that faithful day, it was the second last period before lunch, i received a piece of paper from her close friend Wendy. OfCourse I was terkejut! Her friend told me to not read it immediately. During lunch i was panicking about if i should read it or not, if it's the right timing or not, so instead i chose to read it at home. Once i arrived home, i went to my room and read the paper immediately. Subhanallah, it was a love letter. Although she mentioned to me after that It wasnt supposed to be given to me, but it eventually made it way to me by her friend. The love letter was so cute i wish i could show it here(of course i can't, it's mine only).
                After reading that heartfelt confession, I texted her on IG message, because it was the platform we last communicated. I praised her strawberry cake which she posted on IG story, it was really yummy me likey .

                Apparently, that made her go haywire. The rest was history üòÅ, though just between us.
                I still can't believe how dumb and dense i was back then, how was i not able to pick up these hints!! I'm so grateful we got together though.
