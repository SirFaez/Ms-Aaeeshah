                Before we dated, we"ve known each other for a few years since 2017. I first met her in my ugama class in SOAS, we were in class 4 Alif. During that time, we barely talked or got to know each other. <br><br>
                We met again the next year in PJN during my year 7. We were in the same class, 7B.  I've started to notice and took a liking for her, I've been observing her from afar, but was too much of a coward to start interacting with her. I took a liking to her cutesy and bubbly personality, which stood out to me.  Throughout the year until year 8, all I did was admire her from afar. <br><br>
                In year 9, she mellowed down a bit, but her charm still lingered on me.  After she got together with my closest friend, I sort of gave up, I guess I was too late, but perhaps it was for the better. <br><br>

                In year 11, our final year of school in PJN, she just recently broke up in the earlier months.  I thought to myself, maybe I could try again, but taking advantage of the situation seemed wrong, so I rejected the idea.
