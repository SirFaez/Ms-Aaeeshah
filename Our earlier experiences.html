                Ofcourse, when we first got together, it was flippin awkward obviously ðŸ˜¶. There are some memorable moments i want to share.  <br><br>
It was our 3rd or 4th day together, we were eating lunch together, and we started talking about her cats and their funny stories, we also talked about Evangelion. There i was listening to her talking, it was awkward but comforting and nice, while i was eating my plain dry chicken breast and fried rice. It was later in our relationship when i found out she was silently judging my food! ðŸ˜« <br><br>
On a certain day, we got a bit close, and it was cold inside the classroom. We had our table next to each other and we sat together. During class, I mentioned how my hands were cold, so we sneakily held hands dalam palung. No words were exchanged, just holding hands ^_^. <br><br>
A month i think into our relationship, we started playing games together, one of those games was Roblox. We played this game called Finding Floppa. As the name suggests, you find floppa cat variants that are hidden in the game. During one game, we were close to finding all the cats.
We made a deal, we would help each other out by giving the location of the remaining cats that each of us hasn't discovered yet.  I finished first, but heres the thing, I only had a few undiscovered cats left while she had a lot more. So, after I proclaimed my victory, she got angry at me in a cute way, and it was hilarious! After that incident, the awkward barrier between us crumbled and that was when we started to be more open and comfortable talking to each other. Thanx Roblox ðŸ˜Ž.  <br><br>
